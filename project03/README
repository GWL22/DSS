It is made to improve recommendation algorithm of Expedia hotel recommendation system.
The Expedia want to predict which hotel cluster user belong to. (use Ensemble .py)
But the target is changed 'hotel cluster' to 'is_package'.
The train file, however, is too big to upload github.
I leave a link where you can download the train file.
There are four files on the web site
I use train.csv and test.csv
