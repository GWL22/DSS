It is made to improve recommendation algorithm of Expedia hotel recommendation system.
The Expedia want to predict which hotel cluster user belong to. (use Ensemble_hotel_cluster.py)
But the target is changed 'hotel cluster' to 'is_package'. (use DTC_find_package.py)
The train file, however, is too big to upload github.
I leave a link where you can download the train file.
There are four files on the web site
I use train.csv and test.csv
